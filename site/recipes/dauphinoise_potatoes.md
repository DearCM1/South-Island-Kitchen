## Method

### **Preparation**

1. Preheat the oven to **120°C** (up to 130°C is fine).  
   Prepare a **bain-marie** by placing a deep roasting tray in the oven large enough to hold your dish.

2. In a large bowl or jug, combine the **double cream**, **milk**, **garlic**, **salt**, **black pepper**, and a generous grating of **nutmeg**.  
   Whisk thoroughly.  
   The cream should taste *slightly too salty*—the potatoes will absorb a lot of seasoning.

3. Peel the **potatoes** and slice them **2–3 mm thick** using a mandolin or sharp knife.  
   Do **not** rinse the potatoes.

4. Generously butter a **20 × 16 cm (8 × 6½ inch)** ovenproof dish.

### **Layering**

5. Arrange a rough, even layer of potatoes across the bottom of the dish.

6. Whisk the cream again and pour over enough to lightly cover the potatoes.  
   Press down gently with your hands to remove air gaps.

7. Repeat layering:
   - Potatoes  
   - Stir cream  
   - Pour cream  
   - Press down  

8. When the dish is **halfway full**, sprinkle a **thin, light layer of cheese** across the potatoes.  
   The cheese is for seasoning and richness, not dominance.

9. Continue layering potatoes and cream until nearly full.

10. Finish with a neat final layer of potatoes.  
    Pour over enough cream so it sits **2–3 mm above the potatoes**.

11. Finish with fresh **black pepper** and a final light grating of **nutmeg**.

### **Cooking**

12. Place the dish into the bain-marie.  
    Carefully pour hot water into the roasting tray so it reaches halfway up the sides of the dish.

13. Bake at **120°C for 2–3 hours**.

14. After **45 minutes**, remove from the oven and **gently press the surface** with a spatula or spoon.  
    Repeat this **2–3 times during cooking** to keep the potatoes submerged and ensure proper reduction.

### **Finishing**

15. The dish is ready when:
    - A knife slides through with no resistance  
    - The top is lightly browned and glazed  
    - The cream underneath is fully absorbed and reduced  

16. Rest for **10–15 minutes** before serving.

## Notes

> Cooking low and slow is non-negotiable. Higher temperatures dry the sides and leave the middle wet.

> Pressing during cooking is critical—skip it and you’ll end up with a sloppy centre.

> Holds warm extremely well and reheats without issue. Ideal for dinner parties or service ahead of time.
